<h1>üåç Hello, world!</h1>

üëã My name is Max, I am a passionate FrontEnd Developer with experience in **JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, Node.JS** and with background in product marketing at EdTech startup and recruitment in executive search companies (quite a mix :). **English - advanced.** 

üëÄ Currently I‚Äôm **open to job opportunities** and looking for a Frontend / Fullstack / Junior Backend roles at IT companies. You can find my  [CV here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14sDBBjSi7wwpIOWIALK8UkpDuMHXQHhY/view?usp=sharing)

üìò In 2022 I devoted my time learning **React Hooks, React Router, Node.js, Express.js and SQL** as well as mastering my skills in **BEM methodology**. 
Further plans include Redux and Authentification in Node.js. 

Aside from programming, I am a fan of reading and currently read ['Noise. A Flaw in Human Judgment'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise:_A_Flaw_in_Human_Judgment) 
by D.Kahnemann to improve my decision-making skills. Together with GPT-2 we even wrote a novel called 'Simulation speaks in memes' (in process of publishing).
